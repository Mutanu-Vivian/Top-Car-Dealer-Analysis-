## Procedure  
- Inspect the dataset to check and see if the required information is included, and cleaning the data.
- Design Dashboard on Microsoft Publisher, save as an image for use as a background on PowerBI.
- Extract, Transform and Load the Dataset onto the Desktop PowerBI: making sure the data is consistent with the datatypes, and excluding null values from the dataset.
- Created measures that would form the basis of all calculations.
- Created separate visualisations to answer all the objectives.
- Imported the designed image as a background, and fit all my visualisations.
- Customised the visuals to match the theme of the dashboard, and added date and region slicers to make the dashboard more interactive.

## Insights  
- Botswana leads with the highest revenue.
